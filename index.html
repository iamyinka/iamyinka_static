                        I am a Nigerian <strong>full-stack software engineer</strong> with a passion for music. I
                        discovered my love for
                        music
                        shortly before graduating high school and went on to become a professional drummer for six years
                        before
                        leaving the country to
                        pursue further studies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After over two years of college as a Communications major, I made a difficult decision to quit
                        school
                        and become a self-taught software developer. I spent two years learning and honing my skills
                        before
                        starting out as a freelancer
                        building projects for small businesses.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Eventually, my dedication and hard work paid off when I landed my first full-time job as a
                        programmer
                        two years later. My
                        love for software development and entrepreneurship led me to start me own company, See Sharp
                        Developers.
                        Today, I
                        run my company on the side while working as a full-time Tech Lead at my current place of work.

                        My passion for music has not waned, and I still enjoy playing and listening to music in my free
                        time. I
                        am
                        a testament to the fact that with dedication, perseverance and hard work, anyone
                        <strong>CAN</strong>
                        achieve success in any field.
